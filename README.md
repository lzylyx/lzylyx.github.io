  Facebook AI Research (FAIR), Menlo Park, CA

  

I am a Research Scientist at Facebook AI Research (FAIR) as of 2016. Before that I was with Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), which I joined in 2011 after receiving my PhD. My research interests are in computer vision and deep learning.

I am a recipient of the PAMI Young Researcher Award in 2018, the Best Paper Award in CVPR 2009, CVPR 2016, ICCV 2017, the Best Student Paper Award in ICCV 2017, and the Best Paper Honorable Mention in ECCV 2018. My paper on Deep Residual Networks (ResNets) is the most cited paper in all areas in Google Scholar Metrics 2019. Applications of ResNets also include language, speech, and AlphaGo.
